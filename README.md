# Library Management System

This project is a simple Library Management System developed in Java, featuring a user-friendly interface for managing book records.

## Adding Functionality

The adding function allows users to add new book records to the library database. Here's how it works:

1. *User Interface*: The GUI provides input fields for entering the details of the new book, such as ISBN, book name, author, and publisher.

2. *Add Button*: Upon clicking the "Add" button, the application validates the input fields and inserts the new book record into the database.

3. *Feedback*: After the insertion is completed, the system displays a message dialog confirming the successful addition of the new book.

## Technologies Used
